        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Sage Wallander, and I am a dedicated and passionate student at the University of California, Riverside, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Child Development. I am on a mission to become a Child Life Specialist and work in children's hospitals, making a meaningful impact on the lives of young patients and their families. As a student at the University of California, Riverside, I have been immersed in a rigorous academic program that provides me with a solid foundation in Child Development. My coursework has equipped me with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand the physical, emotional, and cognitive development of children from infancy to adolescence. I have also gained insights into family dynamics and the cultural context in which child development occurs. This education has prepared me to approach child life specialist work with a holistic and empathetic perspective. During my many years of babysitting, nannying, and tutoring, I have had the privilege of working with children of various ages and backgrounds. I observed child development milestones, conducted developmental assessments, and designed age-appropriate activities to stimulate their growth. This experience honed my ability to connect with children, adapt to their individual needs, and promote their emotional and psychological well-being. My desire to become a Child Life Specialist is rooted in a deep-seated passion for making a difference in the lives of children facing health challenges. Over the years, I've come to realize that the strength, resilience, and optimism that children possess, even in the face of adversity, is a remarkable and inspiring force. It's this very inspiration that drives me to dedicate my career to helping them navigate their unique journeys with empathy and care. The role of a Child Life Specialist is one that I hold in the highest regard. These professionals serve as pillars of support, providing comfort, understanding, and a sense of normalcy to children during their hospital stays. I'm profoundly moved by the thought of being there for these young patients, helping them cope with their fears, anxieties, and uncertainties. To me, being a Child Life Specialist is not just a profession; it's a mission to make a positive, lasting impact on the lives of children who are often faced with complex and challenging healthcare journeys. I believe that my educational background, hands-on experiences, and the unwavering dedication to this field uniquely position me to fulfill the responsibilities of a Child Life Specialist. The opportunity to bring joy, play, and emotional support to children, to guide them through medical procedures, and to create an environment where they can flourish despite their circumstances is a calling I am determined to answer. I am committed to a career as a Child Life Specialist, and my educational background, hands-on experience, and personal dedication uniquely position me to make a meaningful impact on the lives of young patients and their families. I am eager to continue my journey towards becoming a Child Life Specialist and to bring my knowledge, skills, and compassion to a healthcare environment where I can support and advocate for children during their most vulnerable moments.
